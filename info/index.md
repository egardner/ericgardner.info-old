Hello world.   
I'm Eric Gardner, a graphic designer living in Los Angeles.

Currently I'm the Senior Designer at the [Hammer Museum](http://hammer.ucla.edu). My responsibilities include design and production of exhibition graphics, signage and wayfinding around the museum, marketing collateral, brochures, web and interactive design, and management of the museum's brand identity.

My other interests include analog and digital [photography](https://www.flickr.com/photos/eric-gardner/sets/), bicycling, [writing code](https://github.com/egardner), and social justice.

This site was hand-built using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), the CMS-free static site generator, and is still under active development.
