Hello world. 

This site is still under active development, so do not be suprised if things change or break periodically.

Eric Gardner is a graphic designer living in Los Angeles. This site is his little piece of the internet. It is hand-built and powered by Jekyll, the CMS-free static-site generator.

Check back here in the future for additional content. In the mean time, if you need to get in touch with him, you can find him at <a href="mailto:{{ site.email }}">{{ site.email }}</a>.
