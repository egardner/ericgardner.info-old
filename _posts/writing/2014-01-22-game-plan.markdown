Here's a list of potential features to include in this site.

###Short-term:

- <del>Mobile-friendly menu (&quot;hamburger&quot;) on top right</del>
- <del>Add date info back to writing posts</del>
- <del>Responsive images</del>
- <del>Project page layout</del>
- <del>Photo gallery for project page?</del>
- analytics
- support for alternate layouts (for photo sections, etc). Maybe the &quot;alternate&quot; layout just applies a body class to the standard page layout to avoid redundancy? Best ways to do this?

###Long-term:

- Add a hook for custom &quot;meta&quot; tags (SEO) in blog posts
- schmancy transitions between page states
- full-bleed image section
- support for &quot;sandbox&quot; content, like JS or processing projects
- more robust navigation for blog section
- ability to page through to projects (&quot;projects&quot; page can be longer than grid on home page &ndash; good idea or not?)

###Content to add:

- AQJ education guide
- Made in LA
-- enviro graphics
-- publication
- Made in LA typeface (Colby Gothic)
- Salome exhibition
- Public Programs posters
-- AILTR
-- Tehran
-- Foster?
