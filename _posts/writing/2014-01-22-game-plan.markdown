Here's a list of potential features to include in this site.

Short-term:
* Mobile-friendly menu ("hamburger") on top right
* Add date info back to writing posts
* more robust navigation for blog section
* ability to page through to projects ("projects" page can be longer than grid on home page – good idea or not?)
* alternatively, should photo stuff be separate?
* analytics
* support for alternate layouts (for photo sections, etc). Maybe the "alternate" layout just applies a body class to the standard page layout to avoid redundancy? Best ways to do this?

Long-term:
* Add a hook for custom "meta" tags (SEO) in blog posts
* schmancy transitions between page states
* full-bleed image section
* support for "sandbox" content, like JS or processing projects
* more things to be determined
