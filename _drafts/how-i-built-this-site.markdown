I'll be making notes here during the development phase of this site with a view towards publishing an extensive essay about the techniques and technologies I used in its creation. This can be my "hello world" post when the site finally is complete.

Things to include:

- Acknowlegments/Thanks
- Technologies utilized
-- Jekyll
-- Skeleton grid
-- Adaptive Images php
-- Typekit
-- Github
-- Sublime text
-- Coda

Topics to touch on:

- Learning by doing
- trying to think like a programmer / de-mistify code
- Simple approach = best approach
